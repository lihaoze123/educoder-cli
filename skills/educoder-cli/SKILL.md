description: Guide Codex through solving or writing code for an EduCoder homework task with educoder-cli. Use when the user asks to solve a Touge/EduCoder task, write an Educoder answer, fetch a homework problem statement, download remote starter code, submit local code for evaluation, or debug an EduCoder evaluation failure using this CLI.

# EduCoder CLI

## Overview

Use `educoder-cli` as the source of truth for task context. Work from real task data, keep credentials and submitted source out of logs, and treat submission as a remote state-changing action.

Read `references/educoder-cli.md` for installation commands, selector rules, JSON fields, and the verified real path.

## Setup

1. Confirm `uv` is available.
2. Install the CLI when the `educoder` command is missing:

   ```bash
   uv tool install git+https://github.com/lihaoze123/educoder-cli
   ```

3. In a clone of this repository, use `uv run educoder ...` instead of the tool command.
4. Log in through the CLI:

   ```bash
   educoder login --login <account>
   ```

   Let the CLI prompt for the password. Do not ask the user to paste passwords, cookies, `zzud`, `autologin`, or `_educoder_session` in chat.

## Workflow

1. Verify the CLI and credentials:

   ```bash
   educoder status --json
   ```

   If running from this repo, use `uv run educoder status --json`.

2. Select the task target.

   If the user did not specify a target, discover candidates:

   ```bash
   educoder courses --json
   educoder homeworks --course <course> --json
   ```

   Prefer exact course/homework identifiers when available. If several plausible targets exist, ask the user to choose before editing or submitting.

3. Read the real problem context:

   ```bash
   educoder task --course <course> --homework <homework> --json
   educoder task --course <course> --homework <homework>
   ```

   Extract the challenge path, statement, test sets, prior compile output, pass/fail status, time limit, and next/previous game identifiers. Use the text rendering when it is easier to read Markdown/HTML problem statements.

4. Fetch the current remote code into a local working file:

   ```bash
   educoder code --course <course> --homework <homework> --output <path> --force --json
   ```

   Use the returned `path` as the remote answer path. Keep downloaded source in a normal working file, not in chat logs or Trellis/research artifacts.

5. Solve locally.

   Inspect the statement and tests first. Preserve the expected remote file type and path, such as `main.py` or a `.circ` file. Use local language/tooling checks when available. For non-code artifacts such as Logisim circuits, avoid rewriting opaque file formats unless you understand the structure.

6. Submit only when safe:

   ```bash
   educoder submit --course <course> --homework <homework> --file <path> --timeout 60 --json
   ```

   `submit` saves code remotely and triggers evaluation. Do not run it unless the user selected the course/homework or the current task target is unambiguous. For exploratory work, stop after preparing the local file and explain the exact submit command.

7. Iterate from feedback.

   On failure or timeout, read the JSON/text submission output and the task detail again. Use `last_compile_output`, test-set `output` versus `actual_output`, and `compile_success` to decide the next edit. Avoid pasting full submitted source or raw payloads into the conversation.

## Safety Rules

- Never print or persist `zzud`, `autologin`, `_educoder_session`, cookies, headers, request bodies, or full raw API payloads.
- Do not store downloaded or submitted source in skill references, Trellis research files, or final answers.
- Treat `code --output` as local file creation and `submit` as remote mutation.
- If the CLI reports ambiguous course/homework matches, show the candidate names/IDs and ask for one target.
- If a task has not been started and no `game_identifier` can be resolved, tell the user to open the experiment in the EduCoder web UI first.

## Completion Checklist

- CLI installed or installation blocker reported.
- Credentials checked or missing-login blocker reported.
- Course and homework target recorded by identifier or ID.
- Problem statement, challenge path, tests, and prior compile output inspected.
- Local answer file created or updated.
- Submission run only when target and remote mutation are appropriate.
- Final answer summarizes pass/fail status, changed local files, and any next command needed.
